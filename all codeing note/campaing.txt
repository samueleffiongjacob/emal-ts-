Female Genital Mutilation is any partial or total removal of the female genitalia for non medical reason. 

 FGM inflicts life-long injuries on women and their female children. It constitutes a violation of women’s fundamental human rights and threats to bodily integrity. 

Globally more than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone female genital mutilation.

The Practice of FGM is high in Nigeria with one-quarter of the global estimates occurring in the country, and it cuts across all socio-cultural and geo-political zones in the country

The physical and psychological damage is likely to continue throughout a survivor's life, limiting her capacity to participate fully in society.

FGM is a criminal offence in Nigeria. Perpetrators can be jailed for 4 years and/or N200,000 fine.

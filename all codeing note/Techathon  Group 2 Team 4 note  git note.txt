The git branch command is used to list all existing
 branches in a repository. An asterisk will appear next to
the currently active branch.

$ git branch
* master



If you're merging a new feature into the main branch, you first want to switch to the main branch and then merge into it:

# ...develop some code...

$ git add –A
$ git commit –m "Some commit message"
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge new-branch



push your branch say 'br-1' to remote using git push origin br-1.
switch to master branch on your local repository using git checkout master.
update local master with remote master using git pull origin master.
merge br-1 into local master using git merge br-1. This may give you conflicts which need to be resolved and changes committed before moving further.
Once merge of br-1 to master on local is committed, push local master to remote master using git push origin master.



how to delete branch:
git checkout branch_name

#where branch_name is the name of the branch you want to move to
#in my case the other branch I have is master, so I'd do:
#git checkout master

git push origin -d server
git reset: to undo all changes made on the local git.

AM HERE TO LEARN FULLSTACK WEBDEVELOPMENT,DEVOPS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING



As a student of federal university of technology we often don't have light on campus and it affects me greatly when l have an idea to work on. If am been given a MacBook it would  be of a greater advantage to me, because of the battery life and the portability which would enable me work at anytime and build ideas and imagination. It would give me great opportunity to work direct with LINUXS  commands instead of the WSL by windows I'm using currently. The WSL slows my 2gb ram laptop down terribly. 

 Being a leader in school, my course mate, senior colleague's and other people who wants to learn  from me but light factor would hinder them from learning. With a mac book l would be able to give back to my community the skills l have for free. 
Freely l acquire freely  l will give to people who needs help also..
